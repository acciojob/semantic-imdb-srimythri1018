    <summary>
      On the lush alien world of Pandora live the Na'vi, beings who appear
      primitive but are highly evolved. Because the planet's environment is
      poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars, must link to human minds
      to allow for free movement on Pandora. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a
      paralyzed former Marine, becomes mobile again through one such Avatar and
      falls in love with a Na'vi woman (Zoe Saldana). As a bond with her grows,
      he is drawn into a battle for the survival of her world.
